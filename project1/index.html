    <h1>Project 1</h1>
<h2>Images of the Russian Empire -- Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection</h2>
<h3> Motivation </h3>
<body> Since elementary school, weâ€™ve learned that a small set of primary colors can combine to produce the full spectrum of colors that are visible to us. But before color photography existed, images were captured in black and white. However, the same scene could be recorded at different intensities of red, green, and blue light. Photographer Sergei Prokudin-Gorskii took advantage of this by capturing three separate exposures, one for each RGB channel, allowing us in the future to reconstruct fully colored photographs. </body>
